    "You wish to become a lich? It's very easy, my friend. Simply find the heart of a lich, combine it with the tongue of a dragon, and cook it with the flesh of a well-ridden horse. This combination is certain to make you undead.",
    "Dragons? Oh, they're everywhere! You must fly very high to see most of them, though. The ones nearer the ground are very hard to see, being invisible.",
    "M'aiq sees lots of them in the ocean. M'aiq knows you'll see one too if you swim far enough.",
    "Horses.... Oh, M'aiq loves horses! Especially with good cream sauce.",
    "You would wish to ride upon a beast? There is a way... Go to one of the many silt-strider ports and pay your fee! You wish one for personal use? Bah! Walk if you must; run if you are chased!",
    "Moving corpses? This sounds frightening to M'aiq. The undead are nothing to be toyed with.",
    "M'aiq does not know this word. You wish others to help you in your quest? Coward! If you must, search for the Argonian Im-Leet, or perhaps the big Nord, Rolf the Uber. They will certainly wish to join you.",
    "A horrible thing indeed. If you see one, let M'aiq know. M'aiq wants to make sure to look in the other direction.",
    "Climbing ropes that hang is too difficult. M'aiq prefers to climb the ones that are tied horizontally.",
    "Feet are for walking. Hands are for hitting. Or shaking. Or waving. Sometimes for clapping.",
    "I do not wish to fight on horseback. It is a good way to ruin a perfectly good horse... which is, to say, a perfectly good dinner.",
    "I don't know why one would want to destroy a building. It takes time to make it. Much time.",
    "Levitation is for fools. Why would we want to levitate? Once you are up high, there is nowhere to go but down.",
    "Why do soldiers bother with target practice? One learns best by hitting real people.",
    "M'aiq was soul trapped once. Not very pleasant. You should think about that once in a while.",
    "Snow falls. Why worry where it goes? M'aiq thinks the snowflakes are pretty.",
    "Werebears? Where? Bears? Men that are bears?",
    "M'aiq knows much, tells some. M'aiq knows many things others do not."
